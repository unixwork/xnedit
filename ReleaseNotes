          Release Notes for XNEdit Version 1.6.1, Jan 2025


This file contains last minute notes to users about the release, which are not
included in the documentation or README files included with the distribution
kits.  It also contains change information, for users who are interested in
what bugs have been fixed, and what features have been added in the current
version.


XNEdit 1.6.1 font exclude option
--------------------------------

To address a bug in older X libraries that causes the X session to crash when
certain emoji characters are used in XNEdit, a new compile option,
-DEXCLUDE_FONTS, has been introduced.

When XNEdit is compiled with -DEXCLUDE_FONTS, a new nedit.rc config is
available:

nedit.excludeFonts: Noto Color Emoji,Symbola

The excludeFonts setting should contain a comma separated list of font names,
that should not be loaded by XNEdit.


XNEdit 1.6.0 alternative Textfield Widget
-----------------------------------------

The alternative text field widget, introduced in version 1.2.1, is now enabled
by default. It can be disabled by adding -DDISABLE_XNE_TEXTFIELD to the CFLAGS.

If the font needs adjustments, it can be changed with this X resource:

*XmTextField.XftFont: Monospace:size=10


XNEdit 1.5.0 Experimental Multi-cursor Support
----------------------------------------------

Additional cursors can be added with Ctrl+Btn1 or Ctrl+Super+Up/Down.
Inserting/deleting text and moving cursors works like single-cursor operations.

Multiple text selections is unsupported.

The multi-cursor feature is still experimental and can change in the future.


XNEdit 1.3.0 EditorConfig Support
---------------------------------

XNEdit supports reading file settings from .editorconfig files
(See https://editorconfig.org/ for details).


New XNEdit 1.3.0 preferences
----------------------------

A new nedit.rc setting for controlling the toolbar icon size is available:

nedit.iconSize: <string>

Possible values are:
small
medium
large

It is also possible to specify the size for individual buttons
(close, isrcFind, isrcClear):

nedit.iconSize: close=medium,isrcFind=large,isrcClear=large


New XNEdit 1.2.1 alternative Textfield Widget
---------------------------------------------

An alternative text field widget with improved unicode support can be used in
the Search/Replace dialogs. This solves the folloing problems:

1. With some locales (non-UTF-8), only ASCII input works
2. Motif's XmTextField does not support fallback fonts with Xft text rendering,
   which limits the variety of characters that could be displayed

To use the new alternative text field widget, add -DXNE_TEXTFIELD to the CFLAGS
variable in the platform specific Makefile.

The alternative widget uses 'XmTextField' as widget class, which means many
styling options (X resources) of Motif's XmTextField can be used. The font of
the new widget can be changed via the 'XftFont' resource. For example:

*XmTextField.XftFont: Monospace:size=10


New XNEdit 1.2 "Insert Unicode" menu entry
------------------------------------------

The new "Insert Unicode" replaces the "Insert Ctrl Code" menu entry,
which wasn't fully functional in XNEdit.

The Insert Unicode dialog allows specifying an Unicode Codepoint in a variety
of formats:

Decimal number, for example: 122
Possible Hex formats (case insensitive):
U+007A
\U007A
U007A
0x7A


New XNEdit 1.1 preferences
--------------------------

XNEdit 1.1 introduces some new preferences, that can be set in the nedit.rc
file (~/.xnedit/nedit.rc). Currently there is no way to set these via GUI.

1. nedit.zoomStep: <int>

Configures how much the zoom-shortcuts Ctrl++ and Ctrl+- change the font size.
Default value is 1.

2. nedit.autoEnableXattr: <boolean>

If true, changing the encoding in the file save dialog to a non-unicode
encoding will activate the "Store encoding in extended attribute" automatically.
Default value is True.

3. nedit.fsbView: <int>

Configures the default view in the file dialog. Possible values are:
    0: icon view
	1: list view
	2: detail view (feature disabled by default)
Default value is 1.

4. nedit.fsbShowHidden: <boolean>

Configures the default value of the "Show hidden files" togglebutton in the
file dialog. Default value is False.

5. nedit.windowDarkTheme: <boolean>

This feature is only available on Gnome 3 and similar desktops. If it is set
to true, the gtk theme variant of the window is set to "dark". This will only
affect the window decoration and not the content.


New feature: "New folder" button
--------------------------------

The file dialog has a new button for creating directories. By default,
the button has an icon and no label. To show the label and no icon, set the
following X resource:

nedit*newFolder.labelType: XmSTRING


Beta feature: detail file view
------------------------------

Additionally to the icon view and list view, the file dialog supports a detail
view, which shows the size and modification date of each file. This feature is
disabled by default. To enable it, add -DFSB_ENABLE_DETAIL to the CFLAGS.


Known issues
------------

With enabled Xft text rendering for Motif widgets, some user interface elements
can only display ASCII characters when using non-UTF8 locales.

The solution is to disable Xft text rendering. This can be done at compile-time
or by changing X resources. The text widget used for editing documents is not
affected.

1. Disable at compile-time

Add -DUSE_XFT=0 to your CFLAGS. This can be done in the platform-specific
Makefile (for example: makefiles/Makefile.linux on Linux).

This does only changes the default X resources.

2. Disable with X resources

Example X resources for using X bitmap fonts for UI elements:

nedit*FontList: \
	-*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1, \
	-*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1=BOLD, \
	-*-helvetica-medium-o-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1=ITALIC
nedit*XmText.FontList: \
	-*-courier-medium-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1, \
	-*-courier-bold-r-normal-*-14-*-*-*-*-*-iso8859-1=BOLD, \
